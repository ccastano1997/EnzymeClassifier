# Enzyme Classification with SVM

This project demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify proteins as enzymes or non-enzymes based on their amino acid composition.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:**  Protein sequences for enzymes and non-enzymes are downloaded from UniProt.
2. **Feature Extraction:**  Amino acid frequencies are calculated for each protein sequence.
3. **Data Preparation:** The data is organized into a CSV file suitable for machine learning.
4. **SVM Model Training:** An SVM model with an 'rbf' kernel is trained on the data.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** `GridSearchCV` is used to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM.
6. **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.
7. **Visualization:** PCA is used to visualize the data and the SVM's classification.

## Files

* `create_dataset.py`: This script downloads protein sequences from UniProt, calculates amino acid frequencies, and creates the dataset CSV file.
* `svm_classifier.py`: This script trains and evaluates the SVM model, performs hyperparameter tuning, and visualizes the results.
* `enzyme_data.csv`:  (This will be generated by `create_dataset.py`) The dataset containing amino acid frequencies and class labels.

## Results

The SVM model with the tuned hyperparameters achieved the following performance on the test set:

* Accuracy: 0.858
* F1 Score: 0.870
